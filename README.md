# Calculator App

## Overview

This project is a simple calculator app that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It was built using the React JavaScript library and follows a functional programming style. The app has a responsive design and can be used on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Features

- Perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Handle negative numbers and decimals
- Responsive design for use on desktop and mobile devices
- Clear, reset, and invert operations
- Percentage operation

## Usage

To use the calculator, simply click on the buttons corresponding to the numbers and operands that you want to use. The display value at the top of the calculator will update as you enter numbers and select operands. To perform a calculation, click the "=" button. The calculator also has clear, reset, and invert buttons that you can use to modify the display value.


## Styling

The app is styled using CSS and flexbox layout. The CSS code in this file styles the layout and appearance of the calculator and its buttons. It uses the Roboto font from Google Fonts and sets it as the default font for the calculator using a custom property (`--font-family`). The `calculator` class sets the overall layout and appearance of the calculator, including its size, border, background color, and padding. The `calculator__display` class styles the display of the calculator, including the font size and color. The `calculator__layout` and `calculator__layout-buttons` classes style the layout of the buttons on the calculator. The `button` class sets the default appearance and behavior of the buttons, and the `number, operation, and #equals` classes override some of these styles for specific types of buttons. The `button:active` style changes the appearance of a button when it is being clicked. The `:hover` styles change the appearance of a button when the mouse cursor hovers over it. Finally, the media queries at the end of the file make the calculator responsive on different screen sizes by adjusting the styles for smaller screens.
